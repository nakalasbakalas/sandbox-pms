# Runbook - Hotel Ops AI Command Center

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies.
2. Configure a local or disposable database URL.
3. Generate the Prisma client.
4. Apply migrations and seed only approved local/staging data.
5. Start the app in server API mode.

Commands:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run db:generate
npm.cmd run db:migrate
npm.cmd run db:seed
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd start
```

Use `VITE_PMS_API_MODE=server` for the frontend to use backend Hotel Ops routes.

## Required Environment

Core:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SESSION_SECRET=...
AUTH_SECRET=...
OTA_DRY_RUN=true
```

Optional remote worker:

```env
OTA_WORKER_BASE_URL=https://...
OTA_WORKER_SHARED_SECRET=...
```

Optional scheduled scans:

```env
HOTEL_OPS_SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
```

Cron expressions can be stored with `HOTEL_OPS_SCAN_CRON`, but cron execution must be provided by external infrastructure calling `POST /api/ops/scan/run`.

OTA credentials must be platform secrets only. Do not commit or log them.

## Daily Operation

Manager:

1. Open `/ops/chat`.
2. Submit a specific operational instruction.
3. Review parsed preview and task status.
4. Use `/ops/tasks` for queue and worker outcomes.
5. Use `/ops/intelligence` for trend alerts and recommendations.

Owner or approver:

1. Open `/ops/approvals`.
2. Review task, platform, dates, rate or availability, proof context, and risk.
3. Approve or deny with an operational reason.
4. Use emergency stop from `/ops/settings` if write automation should pause.

## Scheduled Scan Operation

1. Configure a positive interval in minutes.
2. Restart the app server.
3. Confirm `/ops/settings` shows scheduler state and next scan time.
4. Monitor `/ops/intelligence` for alerts.
5. Treat recommendations as separate approval-gated tasks.

The scheduler runs as `SYSTEM`, skips overlaps, and redacts credential-like failure text.

## Human Challenges

The worker must not bypass CAPTCHA, 2FA, locked-account, or password-expired flows.

When a challenge appears:

1. Mark task `NEEDS_HUMAN`.
2. Store safe trace proof.
3. Notify owner or manager.
4. Let an authorized person complete the challenge outside automated bypass.
5. Resume only when account policy and session state allow it.

## Validation Ladder

For Hotel Ops changes, run the smallest credible checks first:

```powershell
npm.cmd test
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run lint
npx.cmd prisma validate
git diff --check
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run test:e2e
```

For DB lifecycle proof, use a disposable/staging database:

```powershell
$env:ALLOW_DB_E2E='true'
$env:E2E_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://...'
npm.cmd run test:e2e:db
```

Never run DB-mutating E2E against production data.
